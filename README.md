# employee-retention-insights
This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis of employee turnover patterns within an organization using data science techniques. The goal is to understand what factors influence employee attrition and build a predictive model to identify potential leavers.

üìå Objectives

Load and preprocess employee data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualize important trends related to turnover.
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
Provide insights and recommendations to reduce turnover.
üß† Key Techniques Used

Data Preprocessing: Handling null values, encoding categorical data, feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
